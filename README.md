# Art-API-React

A demo using the React Library with multiple external APIs. Style, Information and GPS are all contextual, based on one or more search terms for paintings.

**Explanation**  
This is a newer version of an older project. I was looking for a way to demo React using multiple APIs. It was a struggle at times to make the data between these API's available and relevant to each other while delivering an intuitive experience. Hopefully the overall idea comes through.
